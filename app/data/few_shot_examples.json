    "question": "Consider a scenario where a bookstore offers seasonal discounts on two categories of books. During the winter sale, category A books are offered a 15% discount, and category B books receive a 5% discount. \\newline (i) Define a matrix $D$ to represent the discounted prices such that when multiplied by a matrix $Q$, representing the original prices, the resulting matrix will give the actual prices after discounts for both categories. \\newline (ii) If the original price matrix $Q$ is given as $\\begin{bmatrix} q_1 \\\\ q_2 \\end{bmatrix}$, where $q_1$ and $q_2$ are the original prices of category A and B books respectively, find the product $DQ$.",
    "answer": "\\begin{bmatrix}0.85q_1\\\\0.95q_2\\end{bmatrix}"
