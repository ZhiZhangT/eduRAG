Therefore, the discount factor for category A is 0.85.\n\nFor category B books, a 5% discount means the customer pays 95% of the original price. Therefore, the discount factor for category B is 0.95.\n\nThus, the matrix $D$ that represents these discounts is:\n\n$$ D = \\begin{bmatrix} 0.85 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0.95 \\end{bmatrix} $$\n\nWhen we multiply this matrix $D$ by the original price matrix $Q$, we get:\n\n$$ DQ = \\begin{bmatrix} 0.85 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0.95 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} q_1 \\\\ q_2 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0.85q_1 \\\\ 0.95q_2 \\end{bmatrix} $$\n\nThis result matches the suggested answer, which is $[ 0.85q_1; 0.95q_2 ]$.

Here, the 3rd and 4th numbers are 10 and 12, so the median is (10 + 12) / 2 = 11. This does not match the given median of 10.\n\n2. **Mode:** The mode is the number that appears most frequently. In the list, 12 appears twice, which is more frequent than any other number, so the mode is 12. This matches the given mode.\n\n3. **Mean:** The mean is the sum of the numbers divided by the number of numbers. The sum of the numbers is 6 + 10 + 10 + 12 + 12 + 24 = 74. The mean is 74 / 6 = 12.33, which does not match the given mean of 14.\n\n4. **Range:** The range is the difference between the largest and smallest numbers. Here, the range is 24 - 6 = 18, which matches the given range.\n\nThe suggested answer does not satisfy the conditions for the median and the mean, so it is incorrect.",

For supermarket X, the discount factor is 0.85 (since a 15% discount means the customer pays 85% of the original price), and for supermarket Y, the discount factor is 0.95 (since a 5% discount means the customer pays 95% of the original price). Thus, M can be represented as:\n\nM = [[0.85, 0],\n     [0, 0.95]]\n\n(ii) The matrix T contains the original prices of several items. The product of matrices M and T, denoted as MT, will yield a new matrix where each element represents the discounted price of an item when bought from supermarkets X and Y. This is because the matrix multiplication will apply the respective discount factors to the original prices in T.\n\nTherefore, the suggested answer is correct in stating that the matrix product MT gives the discounted prices, depending on the specific values in matrix T.",

For the numbers 10, 12, 12, 20, 21, the sorted order is 10, 12, 12, 20, 21. The middle number is 12, not 10.

In the set 10, 12, 12, 20, 21, the number 12 appears twice, which is more frequent than any other number. Thus, the mode condition is satisfied.\n\n3. **Mean**: The mean is the sum of the numbers divided by the count of numbers. The sum of 10, 12, 12, 20, and 21 is 75. Dividing by 5 gives a mean of 15, which satisfies the mean condition.\n\n4. **Range**: The range is the difference between the largest and smallest numbers. The range of 10, 12, 12, 20, 21 is 21 - 10 = 11, not 14.
