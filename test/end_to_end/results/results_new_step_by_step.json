The scores are 60, 60, 70, 80, and x. For the median to be 70, x must be either 70 or 80, because if x were less than 70, the median would be less than 70, and if x were greater than 80, the median would be 70.\n\n2. **Mode**: The mode is the most frequently occurring number. The mode is 60, which is consistent with the scores 60, 60, 70, 80, and x, as long as x is not 60.\n\n3. **Mean**: The mean is the average of the numbers. The mean is given as 68. The sum of the scores is 60 + 60 + 70 + 80 + x = 270 + x. The mean is (270 + x) / 5 = 68.

Arranging the suggested scores (83, 85, 86, 88, 88, 93) in ascending order, the third and fourth numbers are 85 and 88. The median is (85 + 88) / 2 = 86.5. However, the problem states the median is 85, so this condition is not satisfied.\n\n2. **Mode:** The mode is the number that appears most frequently. In the suggested scores, 88 appears twice, which is more frequent than any other number, so the mode is 88. This condition is satisfied.\n\n3. **Mean:** The mean is the sum of all numbers divided by the number of numbers. The sum of the suggested scores is 83 + 85 + 86 + 88 + 88 + 93 = 523. The mean is 523 / 6 = 87.1667, which does not match the given mean of 86. This condition is not satisfied.\n\n4. **Range:** The range is the difference between the highest and lowest scores. The highest score is 93 and the lowest is 83, so the range is 93 - 83 = 10.
