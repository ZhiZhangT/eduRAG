Therefore, angle ACB should be half of angle AOB, not half of (180 - 148). The correct calculation is angle ACB = 1/2 * 148 = 74 degrees.\nStep 1: The tangent-segment theorem states that the angle between a tangent and a chord through the point of contact is equal to the angle in the alternate segment. Therefore, angle ADB should be equal to angle TAD, which is 36 degrees, not 70 degrees.\nStep 2: The explanation for parallel lines is incorrect.
