Thus, the mode is 10, which matches the given mode.\n\n3. **Mean**: The mean is the sum of the numbers divided by the count of numbers. The sum of 6, 9, 10, 10, and 24 is 59. Dividing by 5 gives a mean of 11.8, which does not match the given mean of 14. This is incorrect.\n\n4. **Range**: The range is the difference between the largest and smallest numbers. The range of 6, 9, 10, 10, 24 is 24 - 6 = 18, which matches the given range.\n\nThe suggested answer does not satisfy the condition for the median and the mean, hence it is incorrect.",

For the numbers 6, 9, 10, 10, 24, when arranged in ascending order, the middle number is 10. However, the problem states the median should be 9. This suggests a discrepancy, but let's continue checking other conditions.\\n\\n2. **Mode:** The mode is the number that appears most frequently. In the set 6, 9, 10, 10, 24, the number 10 appears twice, which is more frequent than any other number, so the mode is 10. This condition is satisfied.\\n\\n3. **Mean:** The mean is the sum of the numbers divided by the count of numbers. The sum of 6, 9, 10, 10, and 24 is 59. Dividing by 5 gives a mean of 11.8, not 14. This condition is not satisfied.\\n\\n4. **Range:** The range is the difference between the largest and smallest numbers. The range of 6 and 24 is 18, which matches the given range.
